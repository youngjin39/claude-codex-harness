# Changelog

## 2026.05.2 — fleet governance + sub-agent definitions + pattern catalogue

- Added `docs/governance/principles.md` — six fleet-governance principles
  (autonomy / direct-management / skills+tools / per-repo recording /
  catalogue cross-pollination / unused-component archive).
- Added `docs/governance/fleet-observation.md` — public design summary
  of the Facts/Checks/Scorecards 3-layer inspection pipeline, bucket
  decision matrix, S2 autonomous-fix safety net, S3 advisory handoff,
  and S4 import wave rollout (canary → wave 1 → rollback).
- Added four reference sub-agent definitions under `.claude/agents/`:
  `executor-agent` (Codex execution lane), `quality-agent` (Claude
  fallback review), `codex-final-reviewer` (Codex primary review),
  `fleet-doc-steward` (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md drift governance).
- Seeded `docs/patterns/` catalogue with three transplant-ready
  reference patterns + auto-generated `INDEX.md`:
  `bounded-review-plane.md` (curriculum / docs workspaces),
  `app-product-flutter.md` (Flutter app product),
  `content-workspace.md` (narrative / score authoring).

## 2026.05.1 — content expansion

- Expanded README comparison section into a 7-row matrix (vs Claude Code default, Codex CLI default, superpowers, Archon, OpenHarness, claude-code-skills, hand-rolled CLAUDE.md). Names the unique slice this template fills.
- Added 3 examples: `examples/fix-bug/`, `examples/refactor/`, `examples/multi-round-review/` — the last is an anonymized walkthrough of a real multi-round adversarial review that landed a 500-LOC change in 3 rounds.
- Added 3 skills: `deep-interview` (ambiguity gate), `git-commit` (commit hygiene + safety rules), `project-doctor` (health check / drift report).

## 2026.05 — initial public release

- Dual-CLI harness: Claude Code + Codex CLI, identical hook scripts on the 8 shared events.
- 5 hook scripts: `pre-tool-use`, `post-edit-check`, `session-start`, `session-end`, `pre-compact`, plus the `tdd-guard` helper.
- 5 built-in skills: `design`, `writing-plans`, `testing`, `code-review`, `verification`.
- `.ai-harness/` rule set: common rules, development rules, deny-list, TDD matrix, session closeout, failure patterns.
- `tasks/` + `docs/` working ledger.
- Worked example: `examples/add-feature/`.
